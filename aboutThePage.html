    <span class="question">Q: &nbsp; Why did you make a website about Star Trek?  &nbsp; &nbsp;   </span>
    <p class="answer"> A: &nbsp; &nbsp; It was something I knew about. I used to not watch Star Trek but recently I've been getting into it. It's honestly
     not that bad a show though I understand why some people can't get past the first season or two of a given Star Trek show 
     (there are multiple).
    </p>

    <span class="question">Q: &nbsp; Why didn't you include the Romulans in meet the empires?  &nbsp; &nbsp;   </span>
    <p class="answer"> A: &nbsp; &nbsp; I thought about including the Romulans and even got a picture for them, but it felt like
        the list of empires was getting large and other than TNG and a little of DS9 the Romulans aren't mentioned much. I also
        thought about adding The Borg but decided not to because it's difficult to even call them an empire.

    <span class="question">Q: &nbsp; Why does this page have less Javascript than the other pages?  &nbsp; &nbsp;   </span>
    <p class="answer"> A: &nbsp; &nbsp; When making this page I already had a page that had wonky Javascript and techincal things.
        When it came time to make this one I decided to make a simple, nice looking page.
    </p>

    <span class="question">Q: &nbsp; What was the most difficult part of making this website?  &nbsp; &nbsp;   </span>
    <p class="answer"> A: &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding the flex grid. You'd think it would be easy and the concept is but i was surprised at how exact you needed to be,
        I constantly found myself having to tweak the little things, because so much as an element without an assigned grid space could throw off the entire page.
        I did eventually get it done though and i'm proud of the result.

    <span class="question">Q: &nbsp; Where did you get the background image? &nbsp; &nbsp;   </span>
    <p class="answer"> A: &nbsp; &nbsp; The background image is a pretty interesting story. At one point I had looked up the smallest 
        operating system and saw KolibriOs. One day I decided to download it and the background image was what you see now. The orignal
        image had a house island but to make it tileable I removed it. I at one point deleted the OS but decided to keep the background
        since I liked the image so much.
