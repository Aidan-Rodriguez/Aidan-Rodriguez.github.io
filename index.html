         <h2 class="center">What Star Trek Is</h1>
         
         <p> Star trek is a series of tv shows and movies that take place in the Star Trek Universe. There are entres in the series and 
             even I haven't been able to see them all. The Star Trek universe mostly takes place in a universe where warp travel is created.
             this allows for transportation across large areas and leads to a lot more species/cultures than we currently know on earth. Not all
             are friendly and not all are liked (in fact there's lots of wars going on in Star Trek) but interstellar trade is very common. Earth 
             has unified as a planet that has elimated need with a seemingly infinite amount of food/energy. The Humans are also a founding member of
             the Federation of planets, which seeks to unify speacies and allow for peace among worlds.

         <h2 class="center"> Timeline</h2>
         <p>The star trek timeline is a relatively vast and not the easiest to explain timeline spanning multiple series and movies, so I've decided
             to link below an image of the timeline courtesey of <a href="https://infographicjournal.com/star-trek-timeline/">infographicjournal.com</a>
