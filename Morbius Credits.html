    <a href="clickerGame\testdeez2.html">ok, this was an old javascript game i made before i even started taking this class, it uses barebones html and like two things
        with css but it taught me how to code in javascript. i figure that if there's any time to have it present it,
        it's right here, click on this line to be transported to what i call "cookie clicker but bad"
